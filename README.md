# ride-my-way-api
This is a Repo containing the working API endpoints of my routes, for the Ride-my -way carpooling app. 
It is built with travis cI for continous integration and it has some tests to check the endpoints using mocha and chai.

This is the plain repo to be merged with the front end ride-my-way-app.
